# cyborg_math

A crash course on symbolic math with the sympy python package for physicists.

Lesson one focuses on sympy types and arithmetic
Lesson two focuses on single variable calculus
Lesson three focuses on linear algebra

Each jupyter notebook contains worked examples as well as review questions.
Review questions can be validated in real time using the included verification code, so the learner can get immediate feedback.

A pre - requisite to this course is familiarity with python, as well as with the necessary math.
This course is not intended as a comprehensive guide to sympy, but rather to quickly familiarise the learner with the basic concepts of sympy so that they can carry out rudimentary calculations. For advanced features, the reader is referred to the sympy documentation.

This course was tested on sympy 1.5
